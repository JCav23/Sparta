## Section One - HTTP

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application layer in the Internet protocol suite.

it uses a request/response style
*Example:*
User enters URL on a web browser, the browser then creates HTTP request and uses network to send it to the server.
Server then creates HTTP respons and uses the network to send it back to the browser.
The browser will then recieve and interpret the content within that response as a graphical display to the user
This process is also known as rendering.

*** HTTP is a stateless protocol. *** 
Once request/response cycle has been completed the connection can be severed. 
HTTP can also function on persistent conections but generally they are not required.
