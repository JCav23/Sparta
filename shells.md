## What is an Operating System?

Operating System controls the hardware of a computer and consists of:
- Bootloader
- Kernel
- Daemons
- Networking
- Shell - allows manipulation of the device using text based interface 
- GUI - Graphical User Interface
- Applications

### CLI VS GUI

* Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) allow us to interact with the Operating System (OS)
* The Command Line Interface (CLI allows users to type in commands which interacts with the OS
	* CLIS is more difficult to use, but consumes less memory that GUIs
	* CLI is faster and all you need is a keyboard

### Shells
* The Shell is the outermost part of an OS and a program that interacts with user commands
* it is through the shell that the 


### Kernel 
* Kernel is the core of a computers OS and controls all tasks of a computer
* It cannot be overwritten

### Overviews of Shells
* Windows uses PowerShell and Linux uses Bash shell and thankfully they are pretty similar
* Note that on windows computers the first shellls were called MS-DOS! This was because Microsoft actually bought DOS as an operating system and created MS-DOS 

### BASH
* BASH is a popular default shell on linux and macOS
* This is the language that runs in most terminal emulators 
* on Windows we can emilate a Linux environment with GitBash

### nano

* In Linux (and PowerShell) it is important to be able to use built-in editors to edit files. These are different to the standard 'Notepad' with Windows 

### vim 
* Vim is another terminal text editor. Whereas Nano is simple to use and master, vim is tough to master (though powerful!)
