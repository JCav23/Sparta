# PySpark SQL MiniProject

Download a dataset containing a list of [Indian Takeaway Orders](indian-takeaway-orders.zip).  There are ~33k orders from two Indian takeaway restaurants in London between 2015 and 2019.

Load the data into DataBricks and explore it using PySpark SQL.  You will present your findings, showing us the DataBricks Notebook directly.

This is your opportunity to demonstrate that you understand how to use Spark SQL DataFrames, and to do some interesting data exploration.  Try to find a different question to answer than that of the other trainees.

Alternative dataset option: **Nintendo Tweets** JSON data. It's similar to the nintendo tweets - requires using row objects. See attached JSON file.

Another option is a dataset containing a list of **NY Times Hardcover Fiction Best Sellers**. This dataset is made up of csv and json files. See attached JSON file.
